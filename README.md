# Greetings and salutations
I am Neil Olivares Infante applying for this technical exam
before going any further I would like to thank you for this opportunity
on giving me a chance to apply.

the code written here is what my current skill level as a developer is
I do apologize for being rather slow and running out of time as I did not
manage to accomplish making the page mobile friendly due to time constraints.

If the one who will be checking this would not mind, do you mind
if I have technical criticism from a professionals view as I
know to myself that there are some points where I could have done
better on.

Thank you and have a great day
Sincerely, Neil.
